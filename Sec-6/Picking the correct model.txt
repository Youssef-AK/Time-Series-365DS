# Modeling

Steps for most approximator: 

1.   Significant coefficients
2. Parsimonious (as simple as possible)
    - Generally: We prefer
        1. **Simpler model** > Complex model
    - Significantly better predictions:
        1. Simpler < **Complex model** 
    
    <aside>
    ðŸ’¡ **Log-Likelihood Ratio** test (Degree of freedom)
    
    </aside>
    
    - Some total number of lags â€”> No **LLR**
        
         Information criteria [ **AIC , BIC** ]
        
3. Residuals ~ White-Noise
    
    > No patterns we have missed
    > 

- If weâ€™re comparing two models and we want to choose the better fit, then we choose the one with ..
    
    Higher Log-Likelihood and lower Information Criteria.
